I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London, affiliated with the [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/).

My research focuses on **Human-Robot Teaming** and **Human-Robot Interaction**, aiming to develop robotic systems and AI for seamless collaboration between humans and robots, using their complementing competencies to achieve shared goals. A significant focus of my work is the study of human-robot teams and the interactions between humans, AI, and robots, drawing on methods from AI, robotics, human factors, and cognitive science. I emphasise application-driven research in safety-critical and hazardous environments via **Variable Autonomy** paradigms where humans collaborate with robots capable of dynamically changing their level of autonomy and autonomous behaviours. 

Prior to QMUL I was a Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham, leading the human-robot teaming group and a co-founding member of the [Extreme Robotics Lab](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/metallurgy-materials/robotics/index.aspx). I received my PhD from the School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, where I was supervised by [Prof. Rustam Stolkin](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/metallurgy-materials/people/profile.aspx?ReferenceId=133593&Name=professor-rustam-stolkin), [Prof. Nick Hawes](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~nickh/) and [Prof. Kimron Shapiro](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/shapiro-kim.aspx).
