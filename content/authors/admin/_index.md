I am a research fellow in the [Extreme Robotics Lab](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/metallurgy-materials/robotics/index.aspx) and the [National Centre for Nuclear Robotics (NCNR)](https://www.ncnr.org.uk/) at the University of Birmingham, where I lead the human-robot teaming research group. 

My work aims to advance human-robot systems by combining AI, human-robot interaction, and human factors, enabling humans and robots to cooperate efficiently using their complementing capabilities to assist each other during task execution. I am particularly interested in variable autonomy robotic systems with a human-in-the-loop deployed in hazardous or remote environments, keeping humans out of harm’s way. 

I received my PhD from the School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, where I was supervised by [Prof. Rustam Stolkin](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/metallurgy-materials/people/profile.aspx?ReferenceId=133593&Name=professor-rustam-stolkin), [Prof. Nick Hawes](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~nickh/) and [Prof. Kimron Shapiro](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/shapiro-kim.aspx). I have been actively involved in teaching, supervising students, and public communication and engagement of robotics. Among others, I was delivering “robotics masterclasses” for the [Royal Institution of Great Britain](http://www.rigb.org/), the flagship organisation for science outreach and education in the UK and leading the Birmingham autonomous robotics club, winning several prizes in international robotics competitions.
